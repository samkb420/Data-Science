    "Discovery step involves acquiring data from all the identified internal & external sources which helps you to answer the business question.\n",

    "    \n",
    "Data can have lots of inconsistencies like missing value, blank columns, incorrect data format which needs to be cleaned. You need to process, explore, and condition data before modeling. The cleaner your data, the better are your predictions.\n",

    "3. Model Planning:\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this stage, you need to determine the method and technique to draw the relation between input variables. Planning for a model is performed by using different statistical formulas and visualization tools. SQL analysis services, R, and SAS/access are some of the tools used for this purpose.\n",

    "4. Model Building:\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this step, the actual model building process starts. Here, Data scientist distributes datasets for training and testing. Techniques like association, classification, and clustering are applied to the training data set. The model once prepared is tested against the \"testing\" dataset.\n",

    "5. Operationalize:\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this stage, you deliver the final baselined model with reports, code, and technical documents. Model is deployed into a real-time production environment after thorough testing.\n",

    "In this stage, the key findings are communicated to all stakeholders. This helps you to decide if the results of the project are a success or a failure based on the inputs from the model.\n",
